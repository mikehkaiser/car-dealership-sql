# SQL Car Dealership Database creation
The assignment was to make a database in pgAdmin 4 using PostgreSQL language.
My group initially planned out the tables and relationships on Lucidchart and then split up to individually create the database and insert values. This was an 
exercise in basic SQL database creation as well as function creation and use. All values were to be inserted by the makers, with the requirement to 
insert at least two of the values with functions.

I used the opportunity to practice function creation and calling, inserting all values using the functions I made.

More procedures and functions could be made to manage the inventory and customers.
